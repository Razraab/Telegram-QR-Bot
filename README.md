<h2>About</h2>

I warn you that the bot is useless as it creates QR codes with text for MONEY, sounds funny doesn't it?

The bot is considered old due to the relatively recent release of Aiogram 3.0 (In Release 3.7 at the moment).

<h3>Bot manual:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You need a paymaster token, which you then must add to the environment variables called <b>PAYMASTER_TOKEN</b></li>
    <li>Do the same with the token for the bot, but called <b>QR_BOT_TOKEN</b></li>
    <li>Next, open the command line and go to the src directory, activate the virtual environment and run the main.py file</li>
</ul>
