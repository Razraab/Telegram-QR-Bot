Bot manual:

1) You need a paymaster token, which you then
must add to the environment variables called PAYMASTER_TOKEN
2) Do the same with the token for the bot, but called QR_BOT_TOKEN.
3) Next, open the command line and go to the project directory, activate the virtual environment and run the main.py file:

$ cd Project
$ venv\scripts\activate
$ python.exe main.py
